TODO:

[] implement Google authentification
[] create structures of components
[] implement a list of existing habits
[] add a checkbox and a label for each element in the list
[] add a form that adds a habit into the list
[] add a button to remove elements from the list
[] update the list once a day
[] add a progress page with results over time(will need a calendar of some sort)
[] style everything usind tailwind CSS
[] implement the project with React Native(this will be fun)

Each item in the list will have 3 properties: label(emoji), text, checkbox. The label will be automatically generated, but can be changed immediately after with any emoji of choice(will need to use some kind of api for this). After each day all habits go to an "unchecked" state. Lesgo
